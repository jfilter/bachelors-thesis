abstract = {The digital humanities is increasingly becoming a "buzzword", and there is more and more talk about a broadly conceived, inclusive digital humanities. The field is expanding and at the same time being negotiated, and this article explores the idea of a broadly conceived landscape of digital humanities in some depth. It is argued that awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field. The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a "flythrough" of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails. The second part is an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool, study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue.},

abstract = {Traditional software in Formal Concept Analysis makes little use of visualization techniques, producing poorly readable concept lattice representations when the number of concepts exceeds a few dozens. This is problematic as the number of concepts in such lattices grows significantly with the size of the data and the number of its dimensions. In this work we propose several methods to enhance the readability of concept lattices firstly though colouring and distortion techniques, and secondly by extracting and visualizing trees derived from concept lattice structures. These contributions represent an important step in the visual analysis of conceptual structures, as domain experts may visually explore larger datasets that traditional visualizations of concept lattice cannot represent effectively.},

abstract = {We introduce the notion of iceberg concept lattices and show their use in knowledge discovery in databases. Iceberg lattices are a conceptual clustering method, which is well suited for analyzing very large databases. They also serve as a condensed representation of frequent itemsets, as starting point for computing bases of association rules, and as a visualization method for association rules. Iceberg concept lattices are based on the theory of Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical theory with applications in data analysis, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery. We present a new algorithm called Titanic for computing (iceberg) concept lattices. It is based on data mining techniques with a level-wise approach. In fact, Titanic can be used for a more general problem: Computing arbitrary closure systems when the closure operator comes along with a so-called weight function. The use of weight functions for computing closure systems has not been discussed in the literature up to now. Applications providing such a weight function include association rule mining, functional dependencies in databases, conceptual clustering, and ontology engineering. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated and compared with Ganter's Next-Closure algorithm. The evaluation shows an important gain in efficiency, especially for weakly correlated data. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The recent advances in Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) together with the major changes faced by modern Information Retrieval (IR) provide new unprecedented challenges and opportunities for FCA-based IR applications. The main advantage of FCA for IR is the possibility of creating a conceptual representation of a given document collection in the form of a document lattice, which may be used both to improve the retrieval of specific items and to drive the mining of the collection's contents. In this paper, we will examine the best features of FCA for solving IR tasks that could not be easily addressed by conventional systems, as well as the most critical aspects for building FCA-based IR applications. These observations have led to the development of CREDO, a system that allows the user to query Web documents and see retrieval results organized in a browsable concept lattice. This is the second major focus of the paper. We will show that CREDO is especially useful for quickly locating the documents corresponding to the meaning of interest among those retrieved in response to an ambiguous query, or for mining the contents of the documents that reference a given entity. An on-line version of the system is available for testing at http://credo.fub.it.},

The truly worldwide reach of the Web has brought with it a new realization among computer scientists and laypeople of the enormous importance of usability and user interface design. In the last ten years, much has become understood about what works in search interfaces from a usability perspective, and what does not. Researchers and practitioners have developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas, but only the most broadly acceptable make their way into major web search engines. This book summarizes these developments, presenting the state of the art of search interface design, both in academic research and in deployment in commercial systems. Many books describe the algorithms behind search engines and information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of this book is specifically on the user interface. It will be welcomed by industry professionals who design systems that use search interfaces as well as graduate students and academic researchers who investigate information systems.},

@article{Carpineto2005,
abstract = {The potentials of formal concept analysis (FCA) for information retrieval (IR) have been highlighted by a number of research studies since its inception. With the proliferation of small-size specialised text databases available in electronic format and the advent of Web-based graphical interfaces, FCA has then become even more appealing and practical for searching text collections. The main advantage of FCA for IR is the possibility of eliciting context, which may be used both to improve the retrieval of specific items from a text collection and to drive the mining of its contents. In this paper, we will focus on the unique features of FCA for building contextual IR applications as well as on its most critical aspects. The development of a FCA-based application for mining the web results returned by a major search engine is envisaged as the next big challenge for the field.},

abstract = {This book focuses on the human users of search engines and the tool they use to interact with them: the search user interface. The truly worldwide reach of the Web has brought with it a new realization among computer scientists and laypeople of the enormous importance of usability and user interface design. In the last ten years, much has become understood about what works in search interfaces from a usability perspective, and what does not. Researchers and practitioners have developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas, but only the most broadly acceptable make their way into major web search engines. This book summarizes these developments, presenting the state of the art of search interface design, both in academic research and in deployment in commercial systems. Many books describe the algorithms behind search engines and information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of this book is specifically on the user interface. It will be welcomed by industry professionals who design systems that use search interfaces as well as graduate students and academic researchers who investigate information systems.},

abstract = {Understanding the relation between usability measures seems crucial to deepen our conception of usability and to select the right measures for usability studies. We present a meta-analysis of correlations among usability measures calculated from the raw data of 73 studies. Correlations are generally low: effectiveness measures (e.g., errors) and efficiency measures (e.g., time) have a correlation of .247 \&plusmn; .059 (Pearson's product-moment correlation with 95\% confidence interval), efficiency and satisfaction (e.g., preference) one of .196 \&plusmn; .064, and effectiveness and satisfaction one of .164 \&plusmn; .062. Changes in task complexity do not influence these correlations, but use of more complex measures attenuates them. Standard questionnaires for measuring satisfaction appear more reliable than homegrown ones. Measures of users' perceptions of phenomena are generally not correlated with objective measures of the phenomena. Implications for how to measure usability are drawn and common models of usability are criticized.},

abstract = {The questionnaire is an important technique for gathering data from subjects during interactive information retrieval (IR) experiments. Research in survey methodology, public opinion polling and psychology has demonstrated a number of response biases and behaviors that subjects exhibit when responding to questionnaires. Furthermore, research in human-computer interaction has demonstrated that subjects tend to inflate their ratings of systems when completing usability questionnaires. In this study we investigate the relationship between questionnaire mode and subjects' responses to a usability questionnaire comprised of closed and open questions administered during an interactive IR experiment. Three questionnaire modes (pen-and-paper, electronic and interview) were explored with 51 subjects who used one of two information retrieval systems. Results showed that subjects' quantitative evaluations of systems were significantly lower in the interview mode than in the electronic mode. With respect to open questions, subjects in the interview mode used significantly more words than subjects in the pen-and-paper or electronic modes to communicate their responses, and communicated a significantly higher number of response units, even though the total number of unique response units was roughly the same across condition. Finally, results showed that subjects in the pen-and-paper mode were the most efficient in communicating their responses to open questions. These results suggest that researchers should use the interview mode to elicit responses to closed questions from subjects and either pen-and-paper or electronic modes to elicit responses to open questions. ?? 2007.},

In this revised edition of the book that first put protocol analysis on firm theoretical ground, the authors review major advances in verbal reports over the past decade, including new evidence on how giving verbal reports affects subjects' cognitive processes, and on the validity and completeness of such reports. In a substantial new preface Ericsson and Simon summarize the central issues covered in the book and provide an updated version of their information-processing model, which explains verbalization and verbal reports. They describe new studies on the effects of verbalization, interpreting the results of these studies and showing how their theory can be extended to account for them. Next, they address the issue of completeness of verbally reported information, reviewing the new evidence in three particularly active task domains. They conclude by citing recent contributions to the techniques for encoding protocols, raising general issues, and proposing directions for future research. All references and indexes have been updated. K. Anders Ericsson holds the Dr. Edward Conradi Eminent Scholar Chair of Psychology at Florida State University. Herbert Simon is Professor of Psychology at Carnegie-Mellon University. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1978.},

Though many sources describe the foundations of the domain, few discuss practical methods for solving visualization problems.

Although often used to inform the design of information visualization systems, it is unclear what use this has been for visualization designers. We reviewed the current literature that references the mantra, noting what authors have found useful about it and why they cite it. The results indicate a need for empirical validation of the mantra and for a method, such as design patterns, to inform a holistic approach to visualisation design.},

FCA provides a natural way to organize objects according to their properties and it has been used in recent work to organise search engine results. The navigation over the lattice helps the user to explore a structured and synthetic result. Such a lattice contains concepts that are relevant and others that are not relevant regarding a given information retrieval task. In this way, lattices are introduced in an interactive and iterative system. The user expresses his negative or positive agreement with some concept of the lattice in respect with his objective of information retrieval. These user choices are converted into operations over the lattice. The lattice is dynamically updated for a better fit to the request.},

Unlike most applications of Conceptual Clustering to Information Retrieval, JBraindead is not restricted to specific domains, and does not use manually assigned descriptors for documents nor domain specific thesauruses. Given the ranked list of documents from a search, the system dynamically decides which are the most appropriate attributes for the set of documents and generates a conceptual lattice on the fly. This paper focuses on the automatic selection of attributes: first, we propose a number of measures to evaluate the quality of a conceptual lattice for the task, and then we use the proposed measures to compare a number of strategies for the automatic selection of attributes. The results show that conceptual lattices can be very useful to group relevant information in free-text search tasks. The best results are obtained with a weighting formula based on the automatic extraction of terminology for thesaurus building, as compared to an Okapi weighting formula.},
